That is his outsized time being spent at President Trump\u2019s controversial DOGE master. And he finally clearly articulated what must be done to jumpstart an automaker that saw sales and profits fall off a cliff in the first quarter. \u201cStarting early next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop considerably,\" Musk said on the call. The path to renewed sales and profit growth won\u2019t be easy, however. The Tesla brand will likely continue to feel blowback from Musk\u2019s outspokenness on government policies. At the same time, tariff policy stands to hammer margins given Tesla\u2019s exposure to solar panels from China and autos being made outside the US.
